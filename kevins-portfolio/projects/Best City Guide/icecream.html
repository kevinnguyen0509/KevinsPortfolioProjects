			<h2>Fun Facts About Icecream</h2>
			<p><strong>Fact 1: </strong>Contains Vitamins! Yes, just like the vitamins you take daily. Ice cream is actually a great source of calcium, vitamin D, riboflavin, vitamin A and phosphorus. Plus, some ice cream flavors have even more nutrients.</p>
			<p>Vanilla beans have antioxidants as well as calcium, manganese, magnesium, potassium, zinc and iron, making our Original Moose Tracks a perfect treat full of vitamins.</p>
			<p> Dark chocolate is also flooded with antioxidants and contains flavonoids to protect your heart, oleic acid to lower cholesterol levels and phytochemicals to fight off free radicals – so double up on that Moose Tracks Fudge</p>
			<p><strong>Fact 2: </strong>Ice cream helps stimulate the thrombopoietin, which is a hormone that helps reduce stress levels in the body, which is why you might find yourself reaching for a whole carton of Mint Moose Tracks after a stressful day at the office. Ice cream also contains L-tryptophan, which is a natural tranquilizer and helps in relaxing the nervous system. </p>
			<p><strong>Fact 3: </strong>You grew up being told that calcium is good for building strong bones and teeth. And that’s right; in fact, 99% of your bones are made up of calcium and ice cream is a great source of calcium.</p>
